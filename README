Creating business plans with GNU software

This is an example business plan written with Latex.
It also uses other GNU tools such as gnuplot, dia, imagemagick and some others.
You can easily develop your own business plan altering “plan.tex” file provided.
I have also developed make files, that create a graph, convert a picture or sign document.

Here is the step-by-step building instructions :

1. Before start make sure you have installed those tools:

texlive
imagemagick
gnuplot
dia
inkscape

if you use ubuntu linux, you can install all packages with following command.

sudo apt-get install texlive imagemagick gnuplot dia inkscape

2. get sources here
mkdir /tmp/bplan
cd /tmp/bplan
wget https://github.com/ozkolonur/Latex-based-business-plan-template/archive/master.zip
tar xvf https://github.com/ozkolonur/Latex-based-business-plan-template/archive/master.zip

3. use build.sh to build it.
./build.sh

4. plan.pdf should be generated, here is my copy <link>.


you can change company logo using images/letterhead_left.svg
or you can change company tagline using images/letterhead_right_en.svg
You can edit those files with Inkscape.
Inkscape is a free vector image editor.

You can add diagrams using dia.
An example is provided on template. You can use diagrams for organization chart, or entity relations.

You can add graphs using graphs directory, you can write gnuplot scripts if your data is online.
So your tables on your plan can be updated on every build.
You can use this for financial tables as well.

And you can sign your pdf document with your e-signature before giving away your copies.
